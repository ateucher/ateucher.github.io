    "text": "I am a data scientist and package developer with a passion for teaching others how to use data science tools to make their work more efficient and reproducible. My background is in conservation biology, with an MSc in Ecology from the University of Calgary. I have spent much of my career as a data scientist in government, where I made it my mission to use and promote open, reproducible data science practices. I have written many R packages for internal use in my teams as well as for a broader audience, with several hosted on CRAN. I especially enjoy developing packages to make it easier to work with spatial data in R. I am a certified Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructor, and have led many workshops teaching programming skills to scientists and data professionals.\nPlease see my resume for details of my skills and experience."

I felt confident coming back from the workshop and beginning development of my own package. I honestly felt inspired at the end of the day.\n\n\nReally impressive work, I was so thrilled to see efforts to keep it inclusive for learners of all types and abilities. Teaching to a room of folks with wildly varied skill sets is not easy!\n\n\nI felt like the instruction was customized and accessible. Lots of opportunity for questions. It was good being shown different tools for analysis and getting to explore some commonly-used analyses and operations that can be broadly applied. Great course thanks very much!"
